# Shrimpaled Game

## This project is on hold

I had some brill ideas for the game mechanic:

[Simple](https://codepen.io/entozoon/pen/LWVKKm)

[Getting messier..](https://codepen.io/entozoon/pen/dvoxpQ?editors=0010)

But unfortunately this game is so low on my list of boring grownup priorities :(

You're a swordfish! Embrace it. Go on, impale a bunch of shrimp. You know you want to.
